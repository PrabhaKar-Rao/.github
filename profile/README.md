# EazySchool – Backend Development (Spring Boot Project)

A Spring Boot-based backend for a fictional school management system developed as part of a structured project-based learning course. The frontend was sourced externally; all backend logic, services, configuration, and persistence layers were developed and customized independently.



## 🚀 Project Description

This project focuses on implementing robust backend functionality using the Spring Boot ecosystem. It demonstrates the development of secure, validated, and maintainable REST and web endpoints with real-world design patterns and layered architecture.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot** (Core framework)
- **Spring MVC**
- **Spring Security** (Authentication, Authorization)
- **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate**
- **MySQL** (via Docker)
- **Thymeleaf** (Server-side templating)
- **Lombok**
- **ModelMapper**
- **Maven**
- **Git**

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 🔐 **Spring Security Integration:** Custom login form, Remember-Me functionality, and role-based access control for Admin, Student, and User roles.
- ⚙️ **Layered Architecture:** Structured codebase with Controller → Service → Repository separation using interfaces for maintainability and testing.
- 🧠 **REST API Development:** Created RESTful endpoints for student registration, course listing, and contact form handling.
- 🧪 **Input Validation:** Applied JSR 380 (Bean Validation) annotations and custom validators for robust user input enforcement.
- 🚫 **Global Exception Handling:** Used `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` to centralize and simplify error handling across the application.
- 🖥 **Thymeleaf Integration:** Dynamic HTML rendering and form submission handling for various pages like login, dashboard, and contact forms.
- 🐳 **Database Setup:** Integrated MySQL using Docker for quick and consistent database environment setup.
- 🔍 **Logging & Utilities:** Applied SLF4J for logging, Lombok to reduce boilerplate, and ModelMapper for DTO transformations.

## 📈 Performance-Oriented Contributions

- ✅ Integrated server-side validation and global exception handling, reducing form error rate and improving user feedback accuracy.
- 🧼 Streamlined layered architecture and decoupled components improved maintainability and reduced onboarding time for new developers.
- 🚀 Efficient use of JPA queries and transaction management optimized data persistence and application response time.
