# EazySchool – Backend Development (Spring Boot Project)

A Spring Boot-based backend for a fictional school management system developed as part of a structured project-based learning course. The frontend was sourced externally; all backend logic, services, configuration, and persistence layers were developed and customized independently.



## 🚀 Project Description

This project focuses on implementing robust backend functionality using the Spring Boot ecosystem. It demonstrates the development of secure, validated, and maintainable REST and web endpoints with real-world design patterns and layered architecture.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Developed **RESTful APIs** for student registration, contact forms, and dashboard features, enabling seamless **frontend–backend integration**.  
- Implemented **Spring Security** with **custom login**, **"Remember Me"**, and **role-based access** (**Admin**, **Student**, **User**).  
- Followed a **layered architecture** (**Controller → Service → Repository**) to ensure clean separation of concerns and testability.  
- Used **JPA/Hibernate** for data persistence, with **MySQL** as the database, containerized using **Docker**.  
- Applied **server-side validations** and **custom annotations**, reducing form input errors and improving data accuracy.
- Handled **global exceptions** with centralized **error handling** and **user-friendly messages** for improved feedback and debugging.

## 📈 Performance-Oriented Contributions

- ✅ Integrated server-side validation and global exception handling, reducing form error rate and improving user feedback accuracy.
- 🧼 Streamlined layered architecture and decoupled components improved maintainability and reduced onboarding time for new developers.
- 🚀 Efficient use of JPA queries and transaction management optimized data persistence and application response time.
- **Tech stack**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, JPA, MySQL, Docker, Thymeleaf, Maven, Lombok, Git.
